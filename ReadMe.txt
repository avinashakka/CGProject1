CSCI 420: Assignment 1: Height Fields


1. The Code has been written in C Language and has been compiled   
   and executed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 on a Windows 8 
   Operating System.

2. The larger part of the code is unchanged from the starter 
   code.

3. A function drawHeightFieldImage() to draw the Height Field has  
   been defined which reads the color channel for each pixel and 
   then computes the height i.e Z value by converting it to a 
   value between 1-0.

              TopDown Approach by Edward Angel 6th Edition.

4. The timer function implementation has been referenced from  
   www.glprogramming.com.

5. The program gives user the choice to render the image in  
   either Points, Lines or Triangle Strips.

6. By default the image is rendered in Triangle Strips.

7. An additional implementation has been implemented to increase 
   or decrease the height of the image.

8. Mouse can be used for Transformation functions of the image.

9. Rotation in Idle function
